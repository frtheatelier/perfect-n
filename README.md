# Project details

## Premise

A game with a rather simple premise: decrypting encrypted text!

Using Caesar's Cipher and perhaps some pattern recognition, try to uncover the original message by shifting letters. 

General tips are included in the hints, as well as question-specific hints where I give out where spaces are and the last letter. Questions could be quite tricky so don't feel too bad.

## Details

- Questions are randomised at every refresh.
- All messages are in English
- So far there are only 5 different questions to solve. Could add more in the future.
- Answers only include UPPERCASE LETTERS and spaces, no other punctuation. 4/5 of them are English idioms.

## Process

This small project is done solely using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (nothing too fancy here). It's mostly done as practice and to refamiliarise myself with JavaScript (and to fill up time).
